      <p class="lead">We can't help that risks arise intrinsically from complexity, but we can help you build an organization that can prevent and manage them.</p>
      <p>
        We teach firms to identify those risks and to deploy organizational practices designed to increase Organizational 
        Risk Capacity--the ability to manage systemic risk and avoid the cognitive biases and institutional failures 
        that can be found in the aftermath of many catastrophes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By increasing Organizational Risk Capacity, firms improve their approach to risk even as their operations become more complex. 
        In addition to the benefits of robustness, this capacity allows for more agile operations in complex environments and 
        encourages innovation within complex processes, conferring a strategic advantage.

      <p class="lead">It might not always be clear to your organization how understanding risks leads to effective strategy formation. Let us help you.</p>
      <p>
        From foreign exchange volatility to the due diligence required of an investment or acquisition target, risk permeates business. 
        System Logic teaches organizations how to integrate risk-based thinking with the challenges of strategic decision making. For example, 
        by identifying the natural risks your firm owns and acknowledging and hedging other risks, organizations increase their competitive 
        advantage and resiliency to unexpected shocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing complex projects and making decisions that yield consistently good results requires cognitive awareness and organizational structures 
        that acknowledge biases and continually evaluate the divergence between predictions and outcomes.

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Build Resiliency</h2>
      <p class="lead">Resilient organizations mitigate adverse consequences and transform uncertainties into opportunity. We can help you build resiliency.</p>
      <p>
        The seizure of credit markets, a supply-chain failure, or a natural disaster can bring even the most competent and well-run business to a halt. As the world 
        becomes increasingly complex, these disruptions occur more frequently and in an environment of tightly interconnected financial, transportation, and 
        infrastructure systems. Furthermore, the drive to innovate, achieve greater efficiency, and meet the demands of customers and clients means that 
        organizations have less of a buffer when disruptions occur. In short, today’s companies face increasing demands in an increasingly uncertain environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help organizations increase <strong>Robustness</strong>--the ability to withstand shocks and continue operating--thereby mitigating the adverse 
        consequences of today’s increasingly risky world. Beyond mitigation, a resilient organization transforms these uncertainties into a strategic advantage by 
        minimizing downtime and offering robustness as a selling point to partners, consumers, and suppliers.
