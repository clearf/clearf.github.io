SIFMA recently released the key findings of its "Quantum Dawn 2" exercise, a simulation of a systemic cyber attack. SIFMA did well, according to its summary of the after action report and their press release, “Quantum Dawn 2 demonstrated the industry’s resiliency when faced with serious cyber attacks that aimed to steal money, crash systems and disrupt equity market trading." (The full report is only available to exercise participants).

**Commentary**

The exercise is well timed, coming on the heels of both increased general awareness of cyber attacks and recent reports from [DTCC](http://www.dtcc.com/downloads/leadership/whitepapers/Beyond_the_Horizon_White_Paper_Systemic_Risk.pdf) and [IOSCO](http://www.iosco.org/research/pdf/swp/Cyber-Crime-Securities-Markets-and-Systemic-Risk.pdf) on the systemic cyber threat facing the finance industry. 

SIFMA’s exercise complements these reports. [Crisis decision making](http://www.system-logic.com/commentary/posts/NASDAQ%20and%20the%20Facebook%20IPO%3A%20The%20Decision13Yg) benefits tremendously from practice, though only when exercises are realistic enough to capture the stress and uncertainty of real-time decision making. 

In particular, one of the outcomes of the Quantum Dawn II exercise was the "successful execution by the Market Response Committee to close the markets." Recent history shows several instances where firms and exchanges face difficulty stopping trading, highlighted during both the Knight Capital incident and NASDAQ's decision to continue the Facebook IPO despite technical glitches. As such, while practice makes perfect, it seems premature to translate the success of this response to the real world, where business imperatives and regulatory pressures to continue trading are immense. 

Rather than discourage such an exercise, these real-world pressures highlight the role of realistic simulations in forming cohesive responses to crises. SIFMA should be praised for its work toward a more stable market. Indeed, perhaps the next exercise could tackle a topic less "sexy" than cyber security, as the industry has shown itself vulnerable to disruption even when the "attacker" is the market’s own technology systems, rather than a third-party or insider threat with aims of destruction or theft.
