The first sentence has **bold.**  

**Bold***italic.* 

***Bol`dit`alic.***

***Bold** italic.* 

*leading space.*

In a `normal **bold** *it* sentence     `*include* a bunch of whitespace

Just `**bold** *it till the end*. `

***Just `bold it till the end***. `

*This is a normal em sentence.*

*This is a sentence **which** embeds bold.*

*This is a sentence that has [embedded](https://www.linkedin.com/)*[ ](https://www.linkedin.com/)whitespace. 

And here, at the *end.*    

All alone we have a    italic area.
