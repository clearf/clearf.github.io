System Logic Principal András Tilcsik and co-author Christopher Marquis of Harvard University recently published a [paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982) on how companies change their patterns of corporate giving as a result of large, local events. Giving is affected by both planned events like a city hosting the Super Bowl, and unplanned events like an earthquake or hurricane. This research highlights the [complex and profound impact of disasters](http://www.system-logic.com/commentary/posts/The%20Rising%20Cost%20of%20Disaster1ywI) on corporations and communities that System Logic has commented on in the past.
