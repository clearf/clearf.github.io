System Logic Principal Christopher Clearfield and Rotman School of Management Professor András Tilcsik have been selected as the winners of the FT/McKinsey [Bracken Bower](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/62dc730c-8d68-11e5-8be4-3506bf20cc2b.html#axzz3ro8qlxrw) prize. An excerpt of their proposal,  [Rethinking the Unthinkable: Managing the Risk of Catastrophic Failure in the Twenty-First Century](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/b924b14e-8943-11e5-8a12-b0ce506400af.html#rethinking) has been published on the FT's website.

The impetus of the prize, run by The Financial Times and McKinsey & Company, organisers of the Business Book of the Year Award, is to "encourage young authors to tackle emerging business themes... unearth new talent and encourage writers to research ideas that could fill future business books of the year." The winner of the £15,000 prize will be announced at an awards dinner in New York on Tuesday November 17th.
